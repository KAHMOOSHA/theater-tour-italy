          ‘All That's Left to Me’ is a play written and performed by a group of
          young Gazanias aged between the ages of 20 to 25 working remotely with
          young Italians. It was constructed to act as a bridge. Through the
          exchange of cultural knowledge, we were able to gain a deeper
          understanding and appreciation of both Palestinian and Italian
          cultures. This allowed us to recognize shared values and similarities
          between them. Its starting point story is the Odyssey which belongs to
          European culture, but which is reinterpreted in a different cultural
          key the Odyssey served the purpose of this project because the odyssey
          belongs to the European culture even though, in this project, we were
          able to share and explore the common ideals and manners that were
          exactly the same between us so the Odyssey gave us the opportunity to
          know about the same ideals between both the Italian and Palestinian
          team.
